RUN GIT LARGE:

- git init 
- git remote add origin "MY-URL" (do: git remote remove origin ,if you have issues with "fatal remote origin already exists"
- git lfs track "*.weights" (do this when github accidentaly tracks or adds files: git rm -r "filename")
- git add yolov3.weights (do this when github accidentaly tracks or adds files: git rm -r "filename", Might have to do: git add folder/*) 
- git commit -m "Add Comments"
(git commit -m แล้ว Error ใส่ email บัญชี github เราที่จะ Upload)
git config --global user.name "John Doe"	(MAKE SURE TO DO IT WITH QOUTES)
git config --global user.email "johndoe@gmail.com" (MAKE SURE TO DO IT WITH QOUTES)

- git push -u origin master (MAKE SURE TO SPELL ORIGIN RIGHT)
(ใส่รหัlบัญชี github เราที่จะ Upload)
OR

-git pull origin master (maybe. idk when to use this) 

- git pull --rebase origin master
- git push origin master

If you are sure that all changes you want have been made, then go ahead and do this if you are getting an errror (! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs)

VVVVVVV
git push --force origin master

github credential issues fix:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18842120/git-pushing-to-a-private-repo

I was facing the same problem. I was able to solve this by removing old credentials from windows.

|    Open Control Panel from the Start menu
|    Go to User Accounts -> Credential Manager -> Manage Windows Credentials
|    Delete any credentials related to Git or GitHub

Once I did this, it started working again.
------------------------------
github wipe and re push to repo:

"""
First, remove all files from your Git repository using: git rm -r *

After that you should commit: using git commit -m "your comment"

After that you push using: git push (that's update the origin repository)

To verify your status using: git status

After that you can copy all your local files in the local Git folder, and you add them to the Git repository using: git add -A

You commit (git commit -m "your comment" and you push (git push)
"""

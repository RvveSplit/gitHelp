- git push -u origin master (MAKE SURE TO SPELL ORIGIN RIGHT)
(ใส่รหัlบัญชี github เราที่จะ Upload)
OR

-git pull origin master (maybe. idk when to use this) 

- git pull --rebase origin master
- git push origin master

If you are sure that all changes you want have been made, then go ahead and do this if you are getting an errror (! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs)

VVVVVVV
git push --force origin master

github credential issues fix:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18842120/git-pushing-to-a-private-repo

I was facing the same problem. I was able to solve this by removing old credentials from windows.

|    Open Control Panel from the Start menu
|    Go to User Accounts -> Credential Manager -> Manage Windows Credentials
|    Delete any credentials related to Git or GitHub

Once I did this, it started working again.
